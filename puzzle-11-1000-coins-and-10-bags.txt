A dealer has 1000 coins and 10 bags. He has to divide the coins over the ten bags, so that he can make any number of coins simply by handing over a few bags. How must divide his money into the ten bags?

 
  
   

   Solution:
   We can represent any decimal number as weights of binary system. For example, if we want to measure upto 7, first three bags are sufficient.

   1 = 2^0

   2 = 2^1

   3 = 2^0 + 2^1

   4 = 2^2

   5 = 2^2 + 2^0

   6 = 2^2 + 2^1

   7 = 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0

   It can be easily generalized. We can measure upto 2^n â€“ 1.

   Fun is, we can also measure the same using powers of 3. For example, we have bags with 1, 3 and 9 coins,

   1 = 1

   2 = 3-1

   3 = 3

   4 = 3+1

   5 = 9-3-1

   6 = 9-3

   7 = 9+1-3

   8 = 9 -1

   9 = 9

   10 = 9+1

   11 = 9+3-1

   12 = 9+3

   13 = 9+3+1

   From 14 onwards next bag comes into picture.
