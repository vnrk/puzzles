Answer:
At 0 minutes: start both hourglasses at the same time.
At 4 minutes: 4 minutes hourglass runs out and flip it. 7 minutes hourglass is left with 3 minutes.
At 7 minutes: 4 minutes hourglass is left with 1 minute. 7 minutes hourglass runs out and flip it.
At 8 minutes: 4 minutes hourglass runs out and 7 is filled with 6 minutes. Pour sand from 7 minutes hourglass to 4 minutes so that the 4 minutes hour glass becomes full. Now 7 minutes hourglass is left with 1 minute
At 9 minutes: 7 minutes hourglass becomes empty.

Hence we measured 9 minutes.
